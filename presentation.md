## So, what would it mean for Swissquote to do open source ?

## 1. Contribute to existing projects

> We didn't like how __project-x__ worked, so we created __sq-project-x__

sounds familiar ?

> __project-x__ didn't fit exactly our needs, so we contributed the missing features

sounds better, right ?

- Solutions are never a perfect fit

## Pros and cons

- Pro
  - You had to do the work anyway.
  - You are not the only maintainer of your solution. (more code to maintain, yay !)
  - You put a smile on the product's maintainer's face.
  - Your employees will be happy to work on things "they can put on their resume"
- Cons
  - Doing a proper open source contribution takes more time than just doing it for oneself.
  
## An example ?

// TODO :: backstop

## 2. Open Source our own projects

- Sometimes existing solutions just can't solve your problem at hand

## If what you'll create has absolutely no added business value

- Then open source it !

### Existing Examples ?

- Sandbox 3 
- SQUP
- SQ James
- Web Components Core
- Web Assets Library

// TODO more examples



### Historic examples

// These solutions were good at the time, but without the proper maintenance they became ... bad

- IPM
- sq-metrics

// TODO more examples

## False assumptions

- Developers will work for me for free
- I will have a huge community, people will worship us
- I will lose money by giving my technology away for free


## What you win in exchange

- Transparency (Hey that's one of our values :D)
- Visibilty
  - To potential employees (Hey look at the great tech we have !)
  - To tech savvy people
- Your employees no longer work on obscure internal frameworks, you win trust from them.
